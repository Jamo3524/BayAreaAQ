# BayAreaAQ

This map examines how and where pollutant concentrations have changed in the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area between 2000 and 2015.

California is known for both high concentrations of, and efforts to reduce air pollutants. According to the American Lung Association, the worst four US cities, and six of the worst ten, for particle pollution are in California. Likewise, 10 of the worst 25 cities for ozone are in California. Air pollution has significant and uneven impacts to human health. Ozone and particulate matter pollution have been linked to respiratory harm (such as asthma), cardiovascular disease, and developmental harm (American Lung Association, 2022). Often, communities of lower socioeconomic status are left to bear many air pollution’s impacts. Those communities living adjacent to transportation infrastructure (highways, airports, and marine ports), heavy industry, or agricultural polluters, are more likely to be minorities, lower income, and have lower English proficiency (Havard et al, 2009).

Causes of air pollution in California include tailpipe emissions from combustion engines, fire, and residential wood combustion for heat. Air pollution impacts are exacerbated by fog and wind from the Pacific Ocean, and mountain ranges that prevent air pollutants from dissipating. California’s historical land use and transportation policies contribute to air pollution as well. California is known for its sprawling, automobile-dependent suburbs throughout the state.

California has also taken steps to reduce air pollution. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) sets automobile emissions standards that are more stringent than those set by the US EPA. In addition, CARB sets the low-carbon fuel standard, which requires gasoline sold in the state to minimize certain pollutant levels.

The goal of this map is to determine how pollutant concentrations have changed in the San Francisco Bay Area from 2000 to 2015. This map tracks concentrations of three pollutants: ozone, particulate matter, and carbon monoxide, at the census tract level in the bay area. Ozone and particulate matter were chosen due to their impacts on human health, as outlined above. Sources of carbon monoxide emissions include tailpipe emissions and biomass burning. Carbon monoxide has impacts on human health and is an important contributor in the formation of ground-level ozone.
